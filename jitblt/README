Jitblt - Just-in-time compilation of image compositing kernels
Dan Amelang (dan@amelang.net)

What is Jitblt
==============
Jitblt is a library for just-in-time (JIT) compilation of image compositing
kernels. It takes as input a set of compositing parameters (e.g. image formats,
compositing operators, etc) and outputs machine code that implements the
desired compositing operation.

Dependencies
============

Jitblt uses Ian Piumarta's code generation tool code-named "Jolt". To build
Jitblt, you will need to first install the "embeddable Jolt" library
(libjolt) first. To do so, check out Ian's idst repository from here:

  http://piumarta.com/svn2/idst/trunk

The README file found in the root directory of the repository contains
instructions for building and installing libjolt. Questions about libjolt
should be brought up on the mailing list referenced in that same README.
